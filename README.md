# BlackjackProject

Program Overview:

This is a simple program that allows the player to play a simple game of Blackjack against the House (in-game referred to as dealer).  You will be prompted with the option to Hit or Stay as long as you have not Busted (which is a score over 21).  The Dealer will automatically hit until they have reached between 17-21, or will of course bust when they exceed 21.

Lessons Learned:

I did not put pen to paper after feeling an extra review given by Anthony had me on my way, and this is a mistake that will NOT be made again.  Ended up making 4-5 classes that were completely un-needed along with a whole slew of methods that were not needed.  I then switched the general style of putting the program together by writing through main what would need to be done for each step and then ensuring the needed methods and classes were in place.  Also as some point thought we had to have multiple abstract classes, and just got myself into a mess.  A classmate helped me deconstruct some of the bloat and from there I was able to follow rather succinctly the flow of the whole Blackjack process.  Still having trouble with figuring out how to hide the first card of the dealer.
